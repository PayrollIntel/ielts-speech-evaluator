I first met her when I was 15 years old, and she taught me for two years during my crucial formative period. What made Mrs. Johnson so influential was her unique approach to teaching and her genuine care for her students. She didn't just teach us grammar and literature; she taught us how to think critically and express ourselves confidently. She encouraged me to participate in debate competitions and helped me discover my passion for public speaking. Mrs. Johnson also taught me the importance of perseverance when I was struggling with a particularly difficult essay assignment. Instead of giving me the answers, she guided me through the process of research and critical thinking. This person has been important in my life because she shaped not only my academic abilities but also my character. Her influence extends far beyond the classroom, and the confidence and analytical skills she helped me develop have been invaluable in both my personal and professional life.\"\n  }, {\n    id: \"cue_place_001\",\n    category: \"Place\",\n    topic: \"Describe a place you visited that left a strong impression on you\",\n    cueCard: {\n      mainPrompt: \"Describe a place you visited that left a strong impression on you\",\n      bulletPoints: [\"Where this place is\", \"When you visited it\", \"What you did there\", \"And explain why it left such a strong impression on you\"]\n    },\n    preparationTime: 60,\n    speakingTime: [60, 120],\n    sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to describe the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, which I visited last summer during a Middle Eastern tour. Petra is located in southern Jordan and is famous for its rock-cut architecture and historical significance as a trading hub. I spent two full days exploring this UNESCO World Heritage site with a local guide. What struck me immediately was the dramatic entrance through the Siq, a narrow canyon that leads to the iconic Treasury building. The craftsmanship of the Nabataean people was absolutely breathtaking - seeing these elaborate facades carved directly into pink sandstone cliffs was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. During my visit, I hiked to the Monastery, climbed to various viewpoints, and learned about the sophisticated water management systems the ancient inhabitants had created. This place left such a strong impression on me because it combined natural beauty with human ingenuity in a way that felt almost magical. The scale and preservation of the site made history feel tangible and alive. It also made me realize how advanced ancient civilizations were and gave me a deep appreciation for cultural heritage preservation.\"\n  }, {\n    id: \"cue_experience_001\",\n    category: \"Experience\",\n    topic: \"Describe a time when you learned something new\",\n    cueCard: {\n      mainPrompt: \"Describe a time when you learned something new\",\n      bulletPoints: [\"What you learned\", \"When and where you learned it\", \"How you learned it\", \"And explain how this new knowledge has been useful to you\"]\n    },\n    preparationTime: 60,\n    speakingTime: [60, 120],\n    sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to talk about when I learned how to play the piano, which happened about two years ago when I was 28 years old. I had always wanted to learn a musical instrument, but never had the opportunity until I moved into a new apartment where my neighbor happened to be a retired music teacher. I learned through a combination of formal lessons with my neighbor twice a week and daily practice sessions at home. She taught me music theory, proper finger positioning, and helped me progress from simple scales to playing actual songs. The learning process was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I started with basic exercises and gradually worked my way up to playing classical pieces like Bach's Inventions and some contemporary songs. What made the learning process special was the patience and encouragement of my teacher, who adapted her methods to suit my adult learning style. This new knowledge has been useful to me in several ways. Playing piano has become my primary stress-relief activity after long work days. It has also improved my cognitive abilities and memory, and given me a creative outlet that I never had before. Additionally, it's enhanced my appreciation for music and provided me with a skill I can share with others at social gatherings.\"\n  }, {\n    id: \"cue_object_001\",\n    category: \"Object\",\n    topic: \"Describe an important object that you own\",\n    cueCard: {\n      mainPrompt: \"Describe an important object that you own\",\n      bulletPoints: [\"What this object is\", \"How you got it\", \"What you use it for\", \"And explain why it is important to you\"]\n    },\n    preparationTime: 60,\n    speakingTime: [60, 120],\n    sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to describe my grandmother's vintage camera, which is a 1960s Leica that she used throughout her career as a photojournalist. I inherited this camera when my grandmother passed away three years ago, along with several albums of photographs she had taken during her travels around the world. The camera itself is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship - it's made of black metal with silver accents and has that distinctive vintage aesthetic that modern cameras lack. I use this camera for special occasions and personal photography projects. Unlike digital cameras, it requires film, which makes each shot more deliberate and meaningful. I've learned to appreciate the process of manual focusing and adjusting settings based on lighting conditions. This object is important to me for several reasons. Firstly, it connects me to my grandmother's memory and her passion for documenting life's moments. Every time I hold it, I feel connected to her adventurous spirit and artistic eye. Secondly, using this camera has taught me patience and improved my photography skills because I have to think carefully about composition and lighting before taking each shot. Finally, it represents a slower, more mindful approach to photography that contrasts sharply with our instant digital world, and this has helped me become more present and observant in my daily life.\"\n  }, {\n    id: \"cue_event_001\",\n    category: \"Event\",\n    topic: \"Describe a celebration or festival that is important in your country\",\n    cueCard: {\n      mainPrompt: \"Describe a celebration or festival that is important in your country\",\n      bulletPoints: [\"What the celebration/festival is\", \"When it takes place\", \"What people do during this celebration\", \"And explain why it is important in your country\"]\n    },\n    preparationTime: 60,\n    speakingTime: [60, 120],\n    sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to talk about Diwali, which is one of the most significant festivals in India and is celebrated by millions of people worldwide. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, typically takes place in October or November, depending on the lunar calendar, and lasts for five days. During Diwali, people engage in numerous traditional activities. Homes and public spaces are decorated with colorful rangoli patterns, diyas (oil lamps), and string lights. Families clean and renovate their homes, believing this welcomes prosperity and good fortune. People exchange gifts, sweets, and greetings with friends, family, and neighbors. There are also spectacular fireworks displays, special prayers at temples, and elaborate feasts featuring traditional sweets and savory dishes. Markets become bustling with activity as people shop for new clothes, jewelry, and gifts. This festival is important in our country for several reasons. Culturally, it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil, drawing from various Hindu mythological stories. Economically, it's crucial as it boosts retail sales, from clothing and jewelry to sweets and decorations. Socially, Diwali brings communities together, transcending religious and social boundaries as people of different backgrounds participate in the celebrations. It's also a time for family reunions, strengthening bonds between relatives who may live far apart. The festival embodies the values of generosity, gratitude, and renewal that are central to Indian culture.\"\n  }, {\n    id: \"cue_activity_001\",\n    category: \"Activity\",\n    topic: \"Describe a sport or physical activity you enjoy\",\n    cueCard: {\n      mainPrompt: \"Describe a sport or physical activity you enjoy\",\n      bulletPoints: [\"What the sport/activity is\", \"When and where you do it\", \"Who you do it with\", \"And explain why you enjoy this activity\"]\n    },\n    preparationTime: 60,\n    speakingTime: [60, 120],\n    sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to talk about swimming, which has become my favorite physical activity over the past few years. Swimming is a full-body workout that I find both challenging and relaxing at the same time. I typically swim three times a week at the local community pool, usually in the early morning before work starts. The pool opens at 6 AM, and I find that morning swimming gives me energy and focus for the entire day. Sometimes I swim alone, which I actually prefer because it gives me time to think and clear my mind, but occasionally I join group swimming sessions organized by the fitness center. I enjoy swimming for multiple reasons. Physically, it's an excellent cardiovascular workout that strengthens my entire body without putting stress on my joints, which is important since I spend most of my day sitting at a computer. The rhythmic nature of swimming - the breathing, the strokes, the movement through water - has a meditative quality that helps reduce my stress levels significantly. I also love the sensation of being in water; there's something peaceful about the way sound is muffled and how weightless you feel. Additionally, swimming has helped me build discipline and set personal goals, whether it's improving my technique, increasing my endurance, or swimming longer distances. It's become not just a form of exercise, but a crucial part of my mental health and overall well-being routine.\"\n  }],\n  // PART 3: DISCUSSION QUESTIONS (Two-way Discussion - 4-5 minutes)\n  // 4-6

She didn't just teach us grammar and literature; she taught us how to think critically and express ourselves confidently. She encouraged me to participate in debate competitions and helped me discover my passion for public speaking. Mrs. Johnson also taught me the importance of perseverance when I was struggling with a particularly difficult essay assignment. Instead of giving me the answers, she guided me through the process of research and critical thinking. This person has been important in my life because she shaped not only my academic abilities but also my character.

I spent two full days exploring this UNESCO World Heritage site with a local guide. What struck me immediately was the dramatic entrance through the Siq, a narrow canyon that leads to the iconic Treasury building. The craftsmanship of the Nabataean people was absolutely breathtaking - seeing these elaborate facades carved directly into pink sandstone cliffs was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. During my visit, I hiked to the Monastery, climbed to various viewpoints, and learned about the sophisticated water management systems the ancient inhabitants had created. This place left such a strong impression on me because it combined natural beauty with human ingenuity in a way that felt almost magical. The scale and preservation of the site made history feel tangible and alive.

I learned through a combination of formal lessons with my neighbor twice a week and daily practice sessions at home. She taught me music theory, proper finger positioning, and helped me progress from simple scales to playing actual songs. The learning process was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I started with basic exercises and gradually worked my way up to playing classical pieces like Bach's Inventions and some contemporary songs. What made the learning process special was the patience and encouragement of my teacher, who adapted her methods to suit my adult learning style. This new knowledge has been useful to me in several ways. Playing piano has become my primary stress-relief activity after long work days. It has also improved my cognitive abilities and memory, and given me a creative outlet that I never had before. Additionally, it's enhanced my appreciation for music and provided me with a skill I can share with others at social gatherings.\"\n    },\n    {\n      id: \"cue_object_001\",\n      category: \"Object\",\n      topic: \"Describe an important object that you own\",\n      cueCard: {\n        mainPrompt: \"Describe an important object that you own\", \n        bulletPoints: [\n          \"What this object is\",\n          \"How you got it\",\n          \"What you use it for\",\n          \"And explain why it is important to you\"\n        ]\n      },\n      preparationTime: 60,\n      speakingTime: [60, 120],\n      sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to describe my grandmother's vintage camera, which is a 1960s Leica that she used throughout her career as a photojournalist. I inherited this camera when my grandmother passed away three years ago, along with several albums of photographs she had taken during her travels around the world. The camera itself is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship - it's made of black metal with silver accents and has that distinctive vintage aesthetic that modern cameras lack. I use this camera for special occasions and personal photography projects. Unlike digital cameras, it requires film, which makes each shot more deliberate and meaningful. I've learned to appreciate the process of manual focusing and adjusting settings based on lighting conditions. This object is important to me for several reasons. Firstly, it connects me to my grandmother's memory and her passion for documenting life's moments. Every time I hold it, I feel connected to her adventurous spirit and artistic eye. Secondly, using this camera has taught me patience and improved my photography skills because I have to think carefully about composition and lighting before taking each shot. Finally, it represents a slower, more mindful approach to photography that contrasts sharply with our instant digital world, and this has helped me become more present and observant in my daily life.\"\n    },\n    {\n      id: \"cue_event_001\",\n      category: \"Event\",\n      topic: \"Describe a celebration or festival that is important in your country\",\n      cueCard: {\n        mainPrompt: \"Describe a celebration or festival that is important in your country\",\n        bulletPoints: [\n          \"What the celebration/festival is\",\n          \"When it takes place\",\n          \"What people do during this celebration\", \n          \"And explain why it is important in your country\"\n        ]\n      },\n      preparationTime: 60,\n      speakingTime: [60, 120],\n      sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to talk about Diwali, which is one of the most significant festivals in India and is celebrated by millions of people worldwide. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, typically takes place in October or November, depending on the lunar calendar, and lasts for five days. During Diwali, people engage in numerous traditional activities. Homes and public spaces are decorated with colorful rangoli patterns, diyas (oil lamps), and string lights. Families clean and renovate their homes, believing this welcomes prosperity and good fortune. People exchange gifts, sweets, and greetings with friends, family, and neighbors. There are also spectacular fireworks displays, special prayers at temples, and elaborate feasts featuring traditional sweets and savory dishes. Markets become bustling with activity as people shop for new clothes, jewelry, and gifts. This festival is important in our country for several reasons. Culturally, it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil, drawing from various Hindu mythological stories. Economically, it's crucial as it boosts retail sales, from clothing and jewelry to sweets and decorations. Socially, Diwali brings communities together, transcending religious and social boundaries as people of different backgrounds participate in the celebrations. It's also a time for family reunions, strengthening bonds between relatives who may live far apart. The festival embodies the values of generosity, gratitude, and renewal that are central to Indian culture.\"\n    },\n    {\n      id: \"cue_activity_001\",\n      category: \"Activity\",\n      topic: \"Describe a sport or physical activity you enjoy\",\n      cueCard: {\n        mainPrompt: \"Describe a sport or physical activity you enjoy\",\n        bulletPoints: [\n          \"What the sport/activity is\",\n          \"When and where you do it\",\n          \"Who you do it with\",\n          \"And explain why you enjoy this activity\"\n        ]\n      },\n      preparationTime: 60,\n      speakingTime: [60, 120], \n      sampleAnswer: \"I'd like to talk about swimming, which has become my favorite physical activity over the past few years. Swimming is a full-body workout that I find both challenging and relaxing at the same time. I typically swim three times a week at the local community pool, usually in the early morning before work starts. The pool opens at 6 AM, and I find that morning swimming gives me energy and focus for the entire day. Sometimes I swim alone, which I actually prefer because it gives me time to think and clear my mind, but occasionally I join group swimming sessions organized by the fitness center. I enjoy swimming for multiple reasons. Physically, it's an excellent cardiovascular workout that strengthens my entire body without putting stress on my joints, which is important since I spend most of my day sitting at a computer. The rhythmic nature of swimming - the breathing, the strokes, the movement through water - has a meditative quality that helps reduce my stress levels significantly. I also love the sensation of being in water; there's something peaceful about the way sound is muffled and how weightless you feel. Additionally, swimming has helped me build discipline and set personal goals, whether it's improving my technique, increasing my endurance, or swimming longer distances. It's become not just a form of exercise, but a crucial part of my mental health and overall well-being routine.\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  // PART 3: DISCUSSION QUESTIONS (Two-way Discussion - 4-5 minutes)\n
