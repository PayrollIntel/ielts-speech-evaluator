What do you like most about it, and how has it changed over the years?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"My hometown is a beautiful coastal city with stunning beaches and a rich cultural heritage. What I love most about it is the perfect blend of modern amenities and traditional charm. Over the years, I've witnessed significant development in infrastructure, with new shopping centers, restaurants, and recreational facilities. However, the local government has done an excellent job preserving the historical architecture and cultural landmarks.

Reading is probably my favorite because it allows me to explore different worlds and perspectives without leaving my home. I particularly enjoy contemporary fiction and historical biographies, as they provide insights into human nature and different time periods. I also enjoy hiking and photography, often combining the two when I explore nature trails on weekends. These activities help me disconnect from the stress of daily life while keeping me physically active and mentally stimulated.

Do you like cooking? Why or why not?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"I have quite diverse taste in food and enjoy experimenting with different cuisines. I particularly love Italian and Indian food because of their rich flavors and variety. I do enjoy cooking, especially on weekends when I have more time to try new recipes. Cooking is therapeutic for me - it's a creative process that helps me relax after a busy week. I find it satisfying to prepare meals from scratch and share them with family and friends. Recently, I've been learning to cook healthier versions of my favorite dishes, incorporating more vegetables and whole grains. Cooking has also helped me become more organized and patient, as good meals require proper planning and timing.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"personal_005\",\n  category: \"Technology\",\n  difficulty: \"easy\",\n  prompt: \"How do you use technology in your daily life? What's your favorite piece of technology?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"Technology plays a significant role in my daily routine. I use my smartphone for communication, navigation, and staying updated with news and social media. My laptop is essential for work, as I spend most of my day creating presentations, analyzing data, and attending virtual meetings. My favorite piece of technology is probably my tablet because it's versatile - I use it for reading e-books, watching educational videos, taking notes during meetings, and even sketching when I'm feeling creative. I also appreciate smart home devices like voice assistants, which help me manage my schedule and control lighting and music with simple voice commands. Technology has definitely made my life more efficient and connected.\"\n},\n// Part 2 Style Questions - Extended Speaking (2 minutes)\n{\n  id: \"extended_001\",\n  category: \"Travel & Experience\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"Describe a memorable travel experience and explain what made it special. How did it broaden your perspective?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"Last year, I traveled to Japan, which was absolutely extraordinary and life-changing. What made it special was the incredible attention to detail in everything - from the perfectly organized transportation system to the beautiful presentation of food in even the smallest restaurants. I was amazed by how technology and tradition coexisted harmoniously throughout the country. The people were exceptionally polite and helpful, even despite language barriers, which taught me about the universal nature of human kindness. Visiting ancient temples in Kyoto while experiencing the ultra-modern atmosphere of Tokyo gave me a unique perspective on how cultures can preserve their heritage while embracing innovation and progress. This experience broadened my understanding of different approaches to life and made me more adaptable and open-minded in my daily interactions.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"extended_002\",\n  category: \"Learning & Skills\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"Talk about a skill you would like to learn and explain why it interests you. How would you go about learning it?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"I would absolutely love to learn how to play the piano because music has always been a passion of mine, but I never had the opportunity to learn an instrument properly during my childhood. Piano appeals to me because it's incredibly versatile - you can play classical pieces, jazz, contemporary music, or even compose your own original pieces. I believe learning piano would improve my cognitive abilities, provide excellent stress relief after long work days, and give me a creative outlet for self-expression. To learn effectively, I would start with online tutorials and apps to understand basic theory, then progress to formal lessons with a qualified instructor. I'd also practice regularly, set realistic goals for myself, and join local music groups to stay motivated and learn from other musicians in my community.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"extended_003\",\n  category: \"Books & Media\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"Tell me about a book, movie, or TV show that has influenced you. How did it change your perspective on life?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"One book that profoundly influenced me was 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee. It opened my eyes to issues of social justice and the importance of standing up for what's right, even when it's difficult or unpopular. The character of Atticus Finch taught me about moral courage and integrity in the face of adversity. This book fundamentally changed how I view prejudice and discrimination, making me more aware of social issues in my own community and inspiring me to be more empathetic towards others who face challenges different from my own. It also influenced my career choice, as I decided to pursue law to help fight for justice and equality. The book's message about understanding others by walking in their shoes has become a guiding principle in how I approach relationships and conflicts in my personal and professional life.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"extended_004\",\n  category: \"Relationships\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"Describe your best friend and explain why this friendship is important to you. How do you maintain strong relationships?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"My best friend Sarah has been in my life for over ten years, and what makes our friendship truly special is our ability to communicate openly and honestly about anything. She's incredibly supportive during difficult times and genuinely celebrates my successes without any jealousy or competition. We share similar values regarding honesty, loyalty, and personal growth, but we're different enough to learn from each other constantly. To maintain our strong relationship, we make effort to stay in regular contact through weekly phone calls, plan monthly activities together, and always make time for each other despite our busy schedules. We've learned to navigate disagreements respectfully and give each other space when needed. This friendship has taught me the importance of having someone who accepts you completely for who you are, while also encouraging you to become the best version of yourself.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"extended_005\",\n  category: \"Goals & Future Plans\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"What are your career goals for the next five years, and how do you plan to achieve them? What challenges do you anticipate?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"My primary career goal for the next five years is to become a senior software engineer specializing in sustainable technology solutions and artificial intelligence applications.

I'm also planning to attend industry conferences and networking events to stay current with technological advances and connect with professionals in my field. The main challenges I anticipate include keeping up with rapidly evolving technology, managing work-life balance as I advance in my career, and potentially competing with highly skilled professionals from around the world in an increasingly global job market. However, I'm committed to continuous learning and maintaining adaptability to overcome these challenges.\"\n},\n// Part 3 Style Questions - Abstract & Complex Topics\n{\n  id: \"complex_001\",\n  category: \"Technology & Society\",\n  difficulty: \"hard\",\n  prompt: \"Discuss the role of technology in modern communication. What are the advantages and disadvantages you've observed?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"Technology has revolutionized modern communication in remarkable and unprecedented ways. We can now instantly connect with people across the globe through video calls, social media platforms, and messaging applications, which has made the world feel smaller and more interconnected than ever before. This has tremendous advantages for maintaining long-distance relationships, conducting international business, and sharing knowledge rapidly across cultures. However, I've observed significant disadvantages as well. Technology can lead to superficial interactions and reduced face-to-face communication skills, especially among younger generations. There's also the problem of information overload and the spread of misinformation through social media platforms. Privacy concerns and digital addiction are growing issues that affect mental health and personal relationships. The key is finding the right balance and using technology to enhance rather than replace meaningful human connections and authentic communication.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"complex_002\",\n  category: \"Education & Learning\",\n  difficulty: \"hard\",\n  prompt: \"How do you think education will change in the future? What role should traditional schools play?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"I believe education will undergo significant transformation in the coming decades, driven primarily by technological advancement and changing workforce needs. Online learning and personalized education platforms will likely become more prevalent, allowing students to learn at their own pace and focus on subjects that align with their interests and career goals. Artificial intelligence will probably play a larger role in creating customized learning experiences and providing immediate feedback. However, I think traditional schools will continue to play a crucial role in developing social skills, teamwork abilities, and emotional intelligence that cannot be easily replicated in virtual environments. Schools will likely evolve to become more collaborative spaces focused on project-based learning, critical thinking, and creativity rather than memorization. The challenge will be ensuring equal access to quality education regardless of socioeconomic background and maintaining the human element that makes learning engaging and meaningful.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"complex_003\",\n  category: \"Environment & Sustainability\",\n  difficulty: \"hard\",\n  prompt: \"What environmental challenges do you think are most pressing today? How can individuals make a difference?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"The most pressing environmental challenges today include climate change, plastic pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. Climate change is particularly urgent because it affects weather patterns, sea levels, and agricultural productivity worldwide. Plastic pollution is devastating marine ecosystems and entering our food chain, while deforestation contributes to carbon emissions and destroys habitats for countless species. Individuals can make a significant difference through conscious lifestyle choices. This includes reducing energy consumption, using public transportation or electric vehicles, adopting a more plant-based diet, minimizing single-use plastics, and supporting companies with sustainable practices. However, I believe the most powerful individual action is education and advocacy - sharing knowledge about environmental issues and pushing for policy changes at local and national levels. While individual actions are important, systemic change through government policies and corporate responsibility is essential to address these challenges effectively.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"complex_004\",\n  category: \"Culture & Globalization\",\n  difficulty: \"hard\",\n  prompt: \"How has globalization affected traditional cultures? Is this change positive or negative?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"Globalization has had profound effects on traditional cultures, creating both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, it has facilitated cultural exchange, allowing people to learn about different traditions, cuisines, art forms, and philosophies from around the world. This has led to greater tolerance, understanding, and appreciation of diversity. Globalization has also provided economic opportunities for traditional artisans and cultural practitioners to reach international markets. However, there are concerning negative aspects, including the homogenization of cultures and the dominance of Western, particularly American, cultural values. Many traditional languages, customs, and practices are disappearing as younger generations adopt globalized lifestyles. The challenge is preserving cultural authenticity while embracing beneficial aspects of globalization. I believe the key is conscious effort to maintain cultural identity while selectively adopting global influences that enhance rather than replace traditional values. Technology can actually help preserve and share traditional cultures if used mindfully.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"complex_005\",\n  category: \"Work & Career\",\n  difficulty: \"hard\",\n  prompt: \"How do you think the nature of work will change in the next decade? What skills will be most important?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"The nature of work is already changing rapidly, and I expect this transformation to accelerate over the next decade. Remote and hybrid work models will likely become permanent for many industries, fundamentally changing how we think about workplace collaboration and company culture. Artificial intelligence and automation will eliminate some jobs while creating entirely new categories of work that we can't fully imagine yet. The gig economy will continue to grow, giving people more flexibility but also less job security. In this evolving landscape, the most important skills will be adaptability, continuous learning, and emotional intelligence. Technical skills will remain crucial, but the ability to work with AI tools rather than compete against them will be essential. Creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving skills that machines cannot easily replicate will become increasingly valuable. Communication and collaboration skills will be vital as work becomes more project-based and interdisciplinary. Most importantly, the ability to learn new skills quickly and continuously reinvent oneself professionally will be the key to career success.\"\n},\n// Additional Diverse Topics\n{\n  id: \"mixed_001\",\n  category: \"Health & Lifestyle\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"How important is physical fitness in your life? What activities do you do to stay healthy?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"Physical fitness is extremely important to me, not just for maintaining a healthy body, but also for mental well-being and stress management. I've noticed a direct correlation between my fitness level and my energy, mood, and productivity at work. To stay healthy, I maintain a regular exercise routine that includes cardio, strength training, and flexibility work. I go to the gym three times a week for weight training and spend weekends hiking or cycling outdoors. I also practice yoga twice a week, which helps with flexibility and mental relaxation. Beyond exercise, I focus on maintaining a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins while limiting processed foods. I also prioritize getting adequate sleep and staying hydrated throughout the day. What I've learned is that consistency is more important than intensity - even moderate daily activity is better than sporadic intense workouts.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"mixed_002\",\n  category: \"Arts & Creativity\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"Do you enjoy any form of art or creative activities? How does creativity impact your life?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"I'm passionate about photography and digital art, which I practice as hobbies alongside my regular career. Photography allows me to capture and share beautiful moments, whether it's landscapes during my travels or candid portraits of friends and family. I particularly enjoy street photography because it challenges me to find interesting compositions in everyday situations. Digital art has become my creative outlet for self-expression, allowing me to experiment with colors, textures, and abstract concepts. Creativity significantly impacts my life by providing stress relief and mental stimulation outside of work. It has taught me to observe the world more carefully and appreciate aesthetic beauty in unexpected places. These creative activities have also improved my problem-solving skills and ability to think outside the box, which benefits me professionally. Additionally, sharing my work on social media has connected me with a community of like-minded creative individuals worldwide.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"mixed_003\",\n  category: \"Social Issues\",\n  difficulty: \"hard\",\n  prompt: \"What social issues are you most concerned about in your country or community? How can they be addressed?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"The social issues that concern me most in my community are income inequality, access to quality education, and environmental degradation. Income inequality is creating significant disparities in opportunities and quality of life, with many families struggling to afford basic necessities while others enjoy luxury. This is closely tied to educational access, as quality education often depends on socioeconomic status, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Environmental issues like air pollution and inadequate waste management are affecting everyone's health and quality of life. These problems can be addressed through comprehensive approaches involving government policy, community action, and individual responsibility. For income inequality, we need progressive taxation, minimum wage increases, and job creation programs focused on skill development. Educational reform should include increased funding for public schools, teacher training programs, and technology access for underprivileged students. Environmental issues require strict regulations on industrial pollution, investment in renewable energy, and community awareness campaigns about sustainable practices. Most importantly, we need greater civic engagement and accountability from both citizens and leaders.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"mixed_004\",\n  category: \"Family & Traditions\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"Tell me about your family traditions. How important are they to you, and how do you maintain them?\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"Family traditions are incredibly important to me as they provide a sense of continuity, belonging, and shared identity. One of our most cherished traditions is our annual family reunion during the winter holidays, where extended family members from different cities come together for a week of celebration. We have specific rituals like preparing traditional dishes together, sharing stories about family history, and playing games that have been passed down through generations. Another important tradition is our weekly family dinner every Sunday, where we disconnect from technology and focus on meaningful conversation. We also celebrate cultural festivals with traditional foods, decorations, and customs that connect us to our heritage. To maintain these traditions, we make them a priority despite busy schedules and ensure that younger family members understand their significance. We've adapted some traditions to modern circumstances - for example, including virtual participants in our celebrations when travel isn't possible. I believe these traditions strengthen family bonds and provide stability in an increasingly fast-paced world.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"mixed_005\",\n  category: \"Success & Achievement\",\n  difficulty: \"medium\",\n  prompt: \"How do you define success? Describe a personal achievement you're proud of.\",\n  sampleAnswer: \"I define success not just by professional accomplishments or financial achievements, but by personal growth, meaningful relationships, and positive impact on others' lives. True success, in my opinion, is finding balance between personal fulfillment and contributing to something larger than yourself. It's about continuous learning, overcoming challenges, and maintaining integrity in all aspects of life. A personal achievement I'm particularly proud of is completing my master's degree while working full-time and volunteering at a local literacy program. This took three years of careful time management, sacrifice, and determination. What made it especially meaningful was that I was able to apply what I learned in my studies directly to help adult learners improve their reading skills. Seeing the confidence and opportunities that literacy brought to these individuals was incredibly rewarding. This experience taught me that the most satisfying achievements are those that combine personal growth with service to others. It also showed me that with proper planning and commitment, it's possible to pursue multiple meaningful goals simultaneously.\"\n}];\nexport default questionBank;","map":{"version":3,"names":["questionBank","id","category","difficulty","prompt","sampleAnswer"],"sources":["C:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/ielts-speech-evaluator/src/data/questions.js"],"sourcesContent":["// src/data/questions.js - IELTS Speaking Test Question Repository\n\nconst questionBank = [\n  // Part 1 Style Questions - Personal Information & Familiar Topics\n  {\n    id: \"personal_001\",\n    category: \"Personal Information\",\n    difficulty: \"easy\",\n    prompt: \"Tell me about yourself and your background.

What skills will be most important?\",\n    sampleAnswer: \"The nature of work is already changing rapidly, and I expect this transformation to accelerate over the next decade. Remote and hybrid work models will likely become permanent for many industries, fundamentally changing how we think about workplace collaboration and company culture. Artificial intelligence and automation will eliminate some jobs while creating entirely new categories of work that we can't fully imagine yet. The gig economy will continue to grow, giving people more flexibility but also less job security. In this evolving landscape, the most important skills will be adaptability, continuous learning, and emotional intelligence. Technical skills will remain crucial, but the ability to work with AI tools rather than compete against them will be essential. Creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving skills that machines cannot easily replicate will become increasingly valuable. Communication and collaboration skills will be vital as work becomes more project-based and interdisciplinary. Most importantly, the ability to learn new skills quickly and continuously reinvent oneself professionally will be the key to career success.\"\n  },\n\n  // Additional Diverse Topics\n  {\n    id: \"mixed_001\",\n    category: \"Health & Lifestyle\",\n    difficulty: \"medium\",\n    prompt: \"How important is physical fitness in your life? What activities do you do to stay healthy?\",\n    sampleAnswer: \"Physical fitness is extremely important to me, not just for maintaining a healthy body, but also for mental well-being and stress management. I've noticed a direct correlation between my fitness level and my energy, mood, and productivity at work. To stay healthy, I maintain a regular exercise routine that includes cardio, strength training, and flexibility work. I go to the gym three times a week for weight training and spend weekends hiking or cycling outdoors. I also practice yoga twice a week, which helps with flexibility and mental relaxation. Beyond exercise, I focus on maintaining a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins while limiting processed foods. I also prioritize getting adequate sleep and staying hydrated throughout the day. What I've learned is that consistency is more important than intensity - even moderate daily activity is better than sporadic intense workouts.\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"mixed_002\",\n    category: \"Arts & Creativity\",\n    difficulty: \"medium\",\n    prompt: \"Do you enjoy any form of art or creative activities? How does creativity impact your life?\",\n    sampleAnswer: \"I'm passionate about photography and digital art, which I practice as hobbies alongside my regular career. Photography allows me to capture and share beautiful moments, whether it's landscapes during my travels or candid portraits of friends and family. I particularly enjoy street photography because it challenges me to find interesting compositions in everyday situations. Digital art has become my creative outlet for self-expression, allowing me to experiment with colors, textures, and abstract concepts. Creativity significantly impacts my life by providing stress relief and mental stimulation outside of work. It has taught me to observe the world more carefully and appreciate aesthetic beauty in unexpected places. These creative activities have also improved my problem-solving skills and ability to think outside the box, which benefits me professionally. Additionally, sharing my work on social media has connected me with a community of like-minded creative individuals worldwide.\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"mixed_003\",\n    category: \"Social Issues\",\n    difficulty: \"hard\",\n    prompt: \"What social issues are you most concerned about in your country or community? How can they be addressed?\",\n    sampleAnswer: \"The social issues that concern me most in my community are income inequality, access to quality education, and environmental degradation. Income inequality is creating significant disparities in opportunities and quality of life, with many families struggling to afford basic necessities while others enjoy luxury. This is closely tied to educational access, as quality education often depends on socioeconomic status, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Environmental issues like air pollution and inadequate waste management are affecting everyone's health and quality of life. These problems can be addressed through comprehensive approaches involving government policy, community action, and individual responsibility. For income inequality, we need progressive taxation, minimum wage increases, and job creation programs focused on skill development. Educational reform should include increased funding for public schools, teacher training programs, and technology access for underprivileged students. Environmental issues require strict regulations on industrial pollution, investment in renewable energy, and community awareness campaigns about sustainable practices. Most importantly, we need greater civic engagement and accountability from both citizens and leaders.\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"mixed_004\",\n    category: \"Family & Traditions\",\n    difficulty: \"medium\",\n    prompt: \"Tell me about your family traditions. How important are they to you, and how do you maintain them?\",\n    sampleAnswer: \"Family traditions are incredibly important to me as they provide a sense of continuity, belonging, and shared identity. One of our most cherished traditions is our annual family reunion during the winter holidays, where extended family members from different cities come together for a week of celebration. We have specific rituals like preparing traditional dishes together, sharing stories about family history, and playing games that have been passed down through generations. Another important tradition is our weekly family dinner every Sunday, where we disconnect from technology and focus on meaningful conversation. We also celebrate cultural festivals with traditional foods, decorations, and customs that connect us to our heritage. To maintain these traditions, we make them a priority despite busy schedules and ensure that younger family members understand their significance. We've adapted some traditions to modern circumstances - for example, including virtual participants in our celebrations when travel isn't possible. I believe these traditions strengthen family bonds and provide stability in an increasingly fast-paced world.\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"mixed_005\",\n    category: \"Success & Achievement\",\n    difficulty: \"medium\",\n    prompt: \"How do you define success? Describe a personal achievement you're proud of.\",\n    sampleAnswer: \"I define success not just by professional accomplishments or financial achievements, but by personal growth, meaningful relationships, and positive impact on others' lives. True success, in my opinion, is finding balance between personal fulfillment and contributing to something larger than yourself. It's about continuous learning, overcoming challenges, and maintaining integrity in all aspects of life. A personal achievement I'm particularly proud of is completing my master's degree while working full-time and volunteering at a local literacy program. This took three years of careful time management, sacrifice, and determination. What made it especially meaningful was that I was able to apply what I learned in my studies directly to help adult learners improve their reading skills. Seeing the confidence and opportunities that literacy brought to these individuals was incredibly rewarding. This experience taught me that the most satisfying achievements are those that combine personal growth with service to others. It also showed me that with proper planning and commitment, it's possible to pursue multiple meaningful goals simultaneously.\"\n  }\n];\n\nexport default questionBank;"],"mappings":"AAAA;;AAEA,MAAMA,YAAY,GAAG;AACnB;AACA;EACEC,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,sBAAsB;EAChCC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,+EAA+E;EACvFC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,UAAU;EACpBC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,gGAAgG;EACxGC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,qBAAqB;EAC/BC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,4FAA4F;EACpGC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,gBAAgB;EAC1BC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,uEAAuE;EAC/EC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,YAAY;EACtBC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,yFAAyF;EACjGC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC;AAED;AACA;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,qBAAqB;EAC/BC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,+GAA+G;EACvHC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,mBAAmB;EAC7BC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,kHAAkH;EAC1HC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,eAAe;EACzBC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,8GAA8G;EACtHC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,eAAe;EACzBC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,0HAA0H;EAClIC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,cAAc;EAClBC,QAAQ,EAAE,sBAAsB;EAChCC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,6HAA6H;EACrIC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC;AAED;AACA;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE,sBAAsB;EAChCC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,oHAAoH;EAC5HC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE,sBAAsB;EAChCC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,kGAAkG;EAC1GC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACxCC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,4GAA4G;EACpHC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE,yBAAyB;EACnCC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,2FAA2F;EACnGC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE,eAAe;EACzBC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,yGAAyG;EACjHC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC;AAED;AACA;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,WAAW;EACfC,QAAQ,EAAE,oBAAoB;EAC9BC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,4FAA4F;EACpGC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,WAAW;EACfC,QAAQ,EAAE,mBAAmB;EAC7BC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,4FAA4F;EACpGC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,WAAW;EACfC,QAAQ,EAAE,eAAe;EACzBC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;EAClBC,MAAM,EAAE,0GAA0G;EAClHC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,WAAW;EACfC,QAAQ,EAAE,qBAAqB;EAC/BC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,oGAAoG;EAC5GC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,WAAW;EACfC,QAAQ,EAAE,uBAAuB;EACjCC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;EACpBC,MAAM,EAAE,6EAA6E;EACrFC,YAAY,EAAE;AAChB,CAAC,CACF;AAED,eAAeL,YAAY","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
